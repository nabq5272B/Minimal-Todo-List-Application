# To-do list

### Introduction:
A minimal to do list made using the `tkinter`, a `python` binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It's not the best tool to make GUIs as python is an interpreter language, but the most important
thing about this thing is, its easy. I love minimal things, so I buit my own simple to-do list application using it. It has the following features:
- Adding a particular task.
- Removing a particular task.
- Clearing the whole task list.
- Saving the list.

### The GUI:
This is how the GUI will look.

### Installations:
Although there's an executable file in the repository, you can also download and install `python` and `tkinter` in your pc to visualize the code easily.
- For installing python: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`. After that, by following the procedures you can install `python` in your pc.
- For installing `tkinter` use this command: ```pip install tkinter``` and tkinter will be installed.

### FAQ:
1. Why should we use it?
Answer: If you admire minimalism and want to be productive person.
2. How can we use the `.exe` file?
Answer: You'll get the `.exe` file inside the second folder.
3. Where our tasks get saved after we press the `Save List` button?
Answer: It gets stored in a `.txt` file. But you need not to worry about that. Whenever you open the app, you'll see your task saved. Just save the list if you made any changes.
